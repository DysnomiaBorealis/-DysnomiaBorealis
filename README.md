# -DysnomiaBorealis

Just a regular curious guy who's really interested in programming.

I've got some experience building apps for Android using Jetpack Frameworks (both XML and Compose) also I've been learning to develop Multi-Platorm APP via Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile and using Dart via Flutter Framework.

Other than that, I've been delving into Google Collabs using python, just trying to mess and study about Machine Learning and its implementation.
